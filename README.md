## LOAN CALCULATOR </br>


1- Requirements:
Research:

1.	The Aim of the project is to calculate and assign the loan amount to the customer. The system provides two different types of loans: gold loan, car loan. Using various factors such as age, rate of interest and amount required, the total loan amount is calculated and given as output to the customer. The system has gone through various test cases and found efficient to use.
2.	The components/parameters used in this system are: gold in grams, age, interest, Emi and it returns.

My Software:</br>
•	Loan banking facility</br>
•	Saves customer time </br>
•	Easy interaction with customer</br>
